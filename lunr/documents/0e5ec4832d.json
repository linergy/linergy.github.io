Li + High energy and top performance You can count on our long-term experience with leading-edge products of all renowned cell manufactures. Very high energy density forms the basis of compact and light battery packs while great power density guarantees state-of-the-art loadability in a multitude of operational scenarios. Rely on the leading battery technology for your application - you will not regret it! From design to prototype Owing to our in-house manufacturing, we can react immediately to your demands and requirements. Thus we can ensure a seamless transition of the project from design to prototype production. Our flexible automated manufacturing process allows us to maintain cost-efficiency and customer-specific design processes for even small batches. Did you know? Lithium-ion batteries have an up to four times higher energy density than comparable lead cells. Furthermore, they are free from poisonous heavy metals, maintenance-free and long-lasting. This guarantees a very positive environmental record. They have replaced competing battery technologies in almost all relevant use cases and are getting continuously improved by leading manufacturers. info_outline Lithium is the lightest of all elements that are solid at room temperature (0,534 g/cm3). That is why lithium-ion cells achieve the best energy densities of all current cell technologies. From prototype to serial production Think big and utilise our production capabilities for the serial production of battery systems. Even huge quantities pose no problem due to our unique blend automated manufacturing, modern warehouse logistics and in-house development. Certifications Indispensable for professional applications: Certifications and regulatory approvals for battery systems. Linergy offers the following test procedures as a service. wifi EMC Test Testing the electromagnetic compatibility of a system with regards to the emission of interfering fields and its robustness against remote interference is very important to ensure smooth operation of a wide variety of applications. local_shipping UN Transport Test UN38.3 Transporting lithium-ion cells and batteries is subject to special regulations. They must undergo the so-called Transportation Test, which is detailed in the UN testing guideline, part III, section 38.3. Eight different tests are carried out on the unit to be tested to ensure correct and safe operation, even after having been exposed to external influences like vibrations, heat etc. battery_full IEC 62133 IEC 62133 describes the standardised testing of battery systems. The CB certificate, issued according to the International Electrotechnical Commission's standards, allows for easy access to different markets on the basis of multilateral agreements and guarantees conformity of the product with a series of safety regulations."}
