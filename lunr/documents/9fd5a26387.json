Performance and longevity of a lithium-ion battery are closely connected to the appropriate charging equipment. Our modern lithium-ion chargers provide a quick and protecting charging process. That way you will get the most from your battery. Discover our chargers warning Safety Only a special li-ion charger guarantees safe conditions during charging. Improper charging can damage the battery and therefore lead to safety risks. flash_on Performance Our chargers allow you to get the most out of your batteries. Only a charger that is specifically tuned to your battery technology can charge the battery to its full potential. account_balance Efficiency A special charging algorithm protects the battery from premature performance degradation and thus maximizes the operating life of the battery. The result: a longer life and reduced operating costs. Modern charging equipment The CCCV charging method in combination with a specific final charging voltage ensures safe charging of the battery. A precise control of the charging process makes sure that the battery gets always charged to its highest allowed voltage. This gives you more usable electric energy and a stable operating voltage. Aside from the optimized energy efficiency, the chargers prevent overstressing of the battery by limiting the charging current to a safe value. Charge Ladegerät offe The right charger for everyone Regardless of which li-ion battery type you use - we have the right charger for you! A precise tuning of the charger, while taking the specific cell type at hand (LiFePO4, LiMn, LiCoO2...) into account, guarantees safe operation and a great energy yield. We can also cater to your specific use case: Whether you need a powerfol charger for fast charging in your garage or a super-silent compact charger for the office - we can help you with everything concerning charging equipment for li-ion battery packs."}
